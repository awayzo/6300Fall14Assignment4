Each one, if clicked, will lead to the corresponding interface.

After selecting your destination from the start view, the conversion interface will appear.

*First:
Click on the type of conversion from the radio button list at the top of the window.

*Next:
Enter a value you wish to convert into the “Value to Convert” text field.

*Finally:
Click the “Convert” button.

The results will appear at the bottom of the screen in the field labeled ”Answer”.

#WARNING:
If you do not enter a numerical value into the conversion field, the app will default to a 1:1 conversion using the first Radio button as the units of conversion.



#NAVIGATION:
You can return back to the previous view one of three ways:
 
##1: The Options Menu
The Options Menu’s location will very depending on your version of android.  In Android 4.4, or KitKat, it appears in the top right corner by default; After pressing this menu you will be presented with the “Navigation Menu”. From this menu you can navigate to any conversion interface you like.

##2: Launcher Icon:
The launcher icon will send the app to the previous view. (same as the the systems back button)
